# Tennis Player Analysis

Starting from a corpus of 100K players and 200K matches, we divided the players into five distinctive players' profiles based on their game statistics. We then created multiple models to predict the player's profile from their performance.

The project is organized into 3 parts:
- Data Preparation and Understanding
- Clustering
- Classification
